- Allowed buttons to wrap to the next line
  - This also fixes a problem with mobile browsers not being centered
- Moved title to be below Pomelo icon
- Removed arrow icons (I mean its kind of common sense to scroll down)
- Adjusted spacing to make the hero section take up the entire page when entering (needs testing)
  - Right now, theres a -probably- hacky solution for mobile browsers. Might need to be addressed in the future.
- Adjusted about section text
- Update minified files
